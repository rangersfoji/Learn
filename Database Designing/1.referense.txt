---------- References ------------
Look Up table:
    - If the option type data are going to add in same table 
        create new table

    EXAMPLE: 
        - Order table have status 
        - if you have 'delivered' in you status, it is going repeate it self and take more space
            and if you want to chage it, you have to change to all other order with same status
        
    SOLUTION:
        - Create new table for that 
        - Reference it's key to other 
            if you want to change it will be easier and fater
            and if you want to add new column you can do that easily

---------- Revise this -----------

Data design steps:
    conceptual = when you think and draw on paper
    logical = final product of strucured database will be created here
    physical = 
        - what relational database management system use?
        - what are table type?
        - what server are we going to use?
        - is it going to be on server or locally on computer?
        - create views according to person authorizations

------------------ Steps -----------------
1. make draft what are you going to need and create tables 

2. create column properties:

    primary-key
    foreign-key 
    data type
    unique 
    not null
    auto increment
    default value 
    ON_DELETE
    ON_UPDATE

    -----------
    index should create?  
    can be change [if its true then make form to edit/change it. EXAMPLE: change password]

3. create relationships

4. Do followings:
    - Atomic Value: create evey thing atomic way
        EXAMPLE:
            insted of name column create 2 column firstName, lastName, middleName(optional)
    - break one table into two table (create new entity if you can)
    - is any column is eligible for look_up_table [Reference up there]

5. Databse Normalization:
    SETPS:
        - 1st NF (Normal Form)
        - 2nd NF 
        - 3rd NF

        1st Normal Form:
            - data should be atomic 
                EXAMPLE: Username FirstName LastName Address 
                    - here address containes multiple column related to address 
                    - so if you can create different entity then create new table 

                EXAMPLE: If you allow user to have 2 emails
                    - and you try to insert in one email row or create 2 same entry with different email 
                    - it is bad design
                    - so create new table for that 

            - in short any table can not have duplicate data in any column is best design
            

        2nd Normal Form:
            - deals with paritial dependency
                EXPLANATION:
                    - if you have to tables then which column related to which table
                    - related column goes to related table 

                    - in many to many relation ship 
                        - middle/intermediary table will have those column that is related to both table 

            ----------------
            here you implement or draw relationships like 1:1, 1:n, etc.

        3rd Normal Form:
            - deals with transitive dependency
                - it is like column dependends on column which dependends on primary_key

                EXAMPLE : 
                    - review_id | review | star | star_meaning | user_id(FK)

                    - here if you change star then star_meaning will be change 
                    - so star_meaning dependends on star where as star dependends on review

                    - if you want to find this kind of think then think like if you change one column then will any other column change?
                    - then it's need new table

                    - here you create star table :
                            star_id | star | star_meaning

After created databse:
    - Good Design: check every table at least have one natural key 
    - create indexes 
        [figure out all where name = "something", make name index]
        [join to table on t1.first_name = t2.firstName, make index firstName]

        - downsides:
            - it take more time to add/update/modeify/delete that data 
                if you are going to change/insert more than search/read then don't create it

    - create views
    - make form for can be change field/column [if its true then make form to edit/change it. EXAMPLE: change password]

Index:
    Type:
        1. clustered index:
            - data stroed in sorted way
            - can have only 1 [like you can sort data only by name or only by price, etc]
        2. non clustered index:
            - data stored in unorder way but index points to data and index is sorted
            - can have as many as you want

            select * from table where firstName == "karan"
            - always create index for column that you are going to search [here firstName]
        3. composite index:
            EXAMPLE: select * from table where lastName == "Patel" and firstName == "Neel"

            - here you have to create composite key 
                here it optimise and create index for combined firstName and lastName field 
                however if you try to search only first name here, then you have to create different index only for that 

            - here order matter 
                django example: Customer.objects.filter(address__name__favoriteColor)
                sql/mysql example: select * from table where address == "something" and name == "something" and favoriteColor == "something"

                so you have to create composite key in that order

    downsides:
        - it takes more time to create, update, insert, delete 
        - so if you are not going to search about a column, do not make index of that
